        <p>Hi, I am a master's student in the Computational Social Sciences program at the University of Chicago and received my bachelor's degree in Finance in Beijing, China.

          Being extroverted, detailed, and enjoying exploring new things, My curiosity about my career path has led me to have internship experiences within different fields including consulting, data analysis, marketing, and research in the securities market industry.
          
          During my internship, I grew to enjoy programming to complete repetitive tasks efficiently. For example, when I was in Carbon Trust, I was able to reduce my project time by almost 50% by self-programming the carbon emissions path. This also made me feel that a big part of future work will be replaced by programming, which is why I came from a finance major to a computational social science major. I am currently proficient in Python, SQL, Stata, and SPSS.
